*You can say anything from a bug to a debate about sth...*
I'd like to discuss variety of terrain types on map.  
If you want to stick to the classic fantasy i'd like to see:  
* standard grass (bright green)   
* plain grass ( yelowish green or yellow)   
* forest/bush ( dark green)   
* rock ( gray)   
* beach ( bright yellow)   
* ...   
There are some things to consider i think.
